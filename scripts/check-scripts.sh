# Fails when a shell script puts a non-ASCII character right after a variable
# name, as in "$name" followed by an ellipsis: in some locales the shell reads
# the character as part of the name and stops with "unbound variable". Write
# "${name}" before the character instead.

# It uses perl, which macOS and Linux both have; macOS grep has no -P.
